// My algorithm file for the rock paper scissors game.


Organization of how the game will be:
1. Window to run time countdown for the game:
-Window to display: time to play the RPC game against the computer.
-The game stats in T minus (here the countdown begins in 5 seconds);


2. Window with the main game.
-Top header to display the number of rounds the game is playing : eg Round X
- Main section to display the game : Human vs computer.
-A section to display what the human player has selected eg Human has selected Rock and  Computer has selected paper 
- A section to display output of the selection: example Its a tie or Human Player Wins! Rock beats paper


3. Window displaying the winner
-Display the score of the round: Human : 3     Computer: 4
- Display the winner of the round: The Winner of this round is the Computer Player
- Button to prompt the user to play the game again to return to the window with the main game.
